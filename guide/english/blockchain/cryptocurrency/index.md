Cryptocurrency is a subset of digital currency which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as 'crypto' currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. There are various cryptocurrencies including LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, Ripple, and the currently most popular one, Bitcoin. It is the perfect way to make secure and anonymous transactions since it does not involve any third party - there is no central bank. 

Unlike the normal fiat currencies, cryptocurrency can be exchanged as fractions. For example, transactions can amount to 0.00007 BTC or even lower.

If you want to earn bitcoins through mining, it can be done through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate the transactions. Blockchain uses the concept of irreversible cryptographic hash function which consists of guessing a random number (usually more or less than a certain value) to solve the problem for transaction validation. You will require machines with high processing power to be able to solve these problems (for example Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV). Computers with high end graphic cards installed (such as the Nivida GTX 1080) can also solve these hashes effectively.
